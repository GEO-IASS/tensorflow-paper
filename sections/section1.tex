In this section, we aim to give a brief overview and key milestones in the
history of machine-learning programming frameworks and libraries. We begin with
a review of past and existing libraries suitable for a wide range of
machine-learning and statistical analysis purposes, reaching back as far as 30
years ago. We then provide a more focused review of recent programming
frameworks suited especially to the task of deep learning, thus listing and
describing a handful of current competitors of TensorFlow.
