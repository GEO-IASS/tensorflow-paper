\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

We have discussed TensorFlow, a novel open source deep learning library based on
computational graphs. Its ability to perform fast automatic gradient
computation, its inherent support for distributed computation and specialized
hardware as well as its powerful visualization tools make it a very welcome
addition to the field of machine learning. We showed how TensorFlow's
programming interface allowed for easy definition of a simple machine learning
task, forming the basis for more complex models. In the context of other deep
learning toolkits such as Theano or Torch, TensorFlow adds new features and
improves on others. On a qualitative basis, we gave evidence for the competitive
performance of TensorFlow compared to alternative libraries.

TensorFlow has gained great popularity and strong support in the open-source
community with many third-party contributions, making Google's move a sensible
decision already. We believe, however, that it will not only benefit its parent
company, but the greater scientific community as a whole; opening new doors to
faster, larger-scale artificial intelligence.
